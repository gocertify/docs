  <Step title="Add a new page on-site">
    Create a new page on your site to host your OfferHub, most brands use `company.com/offers` or `company.com/discounts`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add OfferHub iFrame to body">
    <Tip>
      Your Gocertify account manager can provide you with the relevant iFrame code for each campaign.
    </Tip>

    Once you have your basic page setup you can paste in the following iFrame within the `<body>` tag. This determines where Gocertify OfferHub will appear.

    ```html iFrame
      <gocertify-hub></gocertify-hub>
    ```
  </Step>
