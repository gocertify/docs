  <Step title="Add a new page on-site">
    Create a new page on your site for each campaign type you want to promote.
    Most brands reference the campaign type within the page url (i.e `company.com/student-discounts`) and add a simple title/description highlighting their offers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add iFrame to body">
    <Tip>
      Your gocertify account manager can provide you with the relevant iFrame code for each campaign.
    </Tip>

    Once you have your basic page setup you can paste in the following iFrame within the `<body>` tag. This determines where gocertify reward flow will appear.

    ```html iFrame
      <gocertify-iframe source="example-campaign"></gocertify-iframe>
    ```
    <Info>
      Remember to replace `example-campaign` with your actual campaign name (e.g. "students").
