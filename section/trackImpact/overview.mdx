The journey of a shopper within Gocertify ends up in the "Tracking link", which in some cases could be an affiliate
link and in others a custom link you've created.

One of the simplest ways to track the impact of your campaigns is to use a special query parameter in this Tracking link
the shopper is sent to after completing their verification, with the details of the campaign or group they
verified.

For example, if you are running campaigns for Students, you can get this information added
like this:

```
https://example.com/your-page?campaign=student
```

This parameter is called `campaign` in the example but it could be any name you want, including an UTM parameter,
like `utm_campaign`.

## Back and forth

Sometimes, you might want to pass some information about the session to us and get it back in the Tracking link (think
about a referral campaign, for example).

To do this, we support 2 special parameters, called `subid` and `clickref`. The only difference between the two is
that `subid` is persisted to the coupon_request, while `clickref` is ephemeral and will only be available in the
current session.

See how to set them in your landing pages [here](/section/gettingStarted/landingPages).
