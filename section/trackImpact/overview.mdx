Gocertify gives you powerful insights into how your rewards are performing site-wide, helping you
understand campaign effectiveness, shopper behavior, and identify opportunities for optimisation. You can view these insights in your [self-serve reporting dashboard](/section/trackImpact/report).

## Dashboard Access
Access to the Gocertify platform is via SSO/password login with enforced two-factor authentication (2FA). Here’s what that means:

- **Password Required:** Users create and manage their own passwords. This reduces the risk of magic-link–related issues (such as intercepted or expired links).
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** 2FA is enforced by default for all users. A one-time code is sent via email, which must be entered alongside the password to complete login.
- **Email-Based 2FA Delivery:** Codes are delivered directly to the user’s registered email address.
- **Secure Session Management:** Each login requires both a valid password and a fresh 2FA code, ensuring that credentials alone are insufficient to gain access.
- **No Sensitive Personal Data Stored:** The Gocertify platform does not store sensitive personal information. It is only used to:
  - View user engagement reports
  - Download CSV exports (if applicable)
  - Configure on-site messaging and campaign settings

## Implementing Tracking
To gain a full picture of your shoppers you will need to implement tracking at two key stages of the shopper journey:

- [Post-verification](/section/trackImpact/shopperInsights) to understand who's visiting your site
- [Post-conversion](/section/trackImpact/transactionTracking) to understand who's purchasing from you
