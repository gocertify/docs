Gocertify gives you powerful insights into how your rewards are performing site-wide, helping you
understand campaign effectiveness, shopper behavior, and identify opportunities for optimisation. You can view these insights in your [self-serve reporting dashboard](/section/trackImpact/report).

## Dashboard Access
Access to the Gocertify platform is via a magic link, which is a secure, time-limited URL sent to a user's email address. Here's what that means:
- **No Password Required:** Users do not create or manage passwords. This reduces the risk of password-related breaches (like reused or weak passwords).
- **Email-Based Authentication:** The link is emailed directly to the userâ€™s registered address, and clicking it logs them in automatically.
- **Expiration Window:** Each link is valid for 8 hours. After that, it becomes inactive, and the user must request a new one.
- **One-Time Use:** Magic links are single-use and tied to a session. This adds another layer of security.
- **No Personal Data Stored:** The Gocertify platform does not contain sensitive personal data. It is only used to:
  - View user engagement reports.
  - Download CSV exports (if applicable).
  - Configure on-site messaging and campaign settings.

## Implementing Tracking
To gain a full picture of your shoppers you will need to implement tracking at two key stages of the shopper journey:

- [Post-verification](/section/trackImpact/shopperInsights) to understand who's visiting your site
- [Post-conversion](/section/trackImpact/transactionTracking) to understand who's purchasing from you
