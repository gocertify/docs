<Tip>
  This feature is in active development and will be available soon.
</Tip>

In order to track conversions in your website you will need to add 2 small snippets of code to your website.


<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure Gocertify.js is implemented site-wide">
    Ensure you have the Gocertify.js head script implemented site-wide (see [integration guide](/section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite)).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a Gocertify session">
    To initiate tracking you will need to start a Gocertify session. You can call this function multiple times for a single shopper, so it's often easiest to call this function on `page-view`.

    ```js session
    gocertify.startSession();
    ```

    <Info>
      This snippet will generate a random (and anonymous) session id and store it in the browser's session storage.
      You might need consent from shoppers before calling this function (i.e. add to your cookie consent banner).
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track the conversion">
    In the post-checkout page (the "thank you" page) track the conversion by calling the `conversion` function:
    ```js conversion
    gocertify.conversion({
      orderId: orderId,
      amount: amount,
      currency: currency,
      discountCode: discountCode,
      productsQuantity: productsQuantity
    })
    ```
    Please note that the `orderId`, `amount` and `currency` are required fields. The `discountCode` and `productsQuantity` are optional.
