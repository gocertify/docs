After a shopper completes a purchase, you need a way to connect that transaction back to the campaign and group they were verified with. Gocertify offers two methods to track these conversions:

- [Affiliate Network Integration](/section/trackImpact/affiliateTracking) for brands using an affiliate network, such as Awin or Rakuten.
- [Direct Conversion Tracking](/section/trackImpact/directTracking) for brands that want to track conversions directly.
