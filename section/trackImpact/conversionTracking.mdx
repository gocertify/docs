In order to track conversions in your website you will need to add 2 small snippets of code to your website.


<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Gocertify session">
    In every page of your website you will need to start a Gocertify session. There is no problem if you call it more than once.

    ```js session
    gocertify.startSession();
    ```

    <Info>
      This snippet will generate a random (and anonymous) session id and store it in the browser's session storage.
      You might need to ask for consent before adding this snippet to your website.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track the conversion">
    In the page after the checkout (the "thank you" page) you will need to track the conversion using this snippet.
    ```js conversion
    gocertify.conversion({
      orderId: orderId,
      amount: amount,
      currency: currency,
      discountCode: discountCode,
      productsQuantity: productsQuantity
    })
    ```
    Please note that the `orderId`, `amount` and `currency` are required fields. The `discountCode` and `productsQuantity` are optional.
