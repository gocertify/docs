Landing pages are a powerful tool for converting key communities and boosting your SEO. To get the most out of the gocertify experience we recommend you: 


  * **Create a landing page** for each of your high value campaigns (i.e. 20% off for Students) 
  * **Create multi-offers page** to showcase all your discounts in one place. 

## Create Campaign landing pages
<Tip>
  Best practice is to create dedicated landing pages for your high-priority communities, like Key Workers and Students.

  To increase SEO traffic ensure that the group name and “discount” is mentioned.

  - **Clear Page Slug:** i.e `student`, `key-worker`, `senior`, `youth`, `disability`
  - **Meta title and H1:** _company_ student discount
  - **Meta description:** We know that a little help goes a long way when you're a student. Verify your student status and you can get 10% off.
  - **Relevant Copy:** ~300 words talking about the campaign and why it's important to your audience.

## Create multi-offers page

OfferHub is a centralised location for all your discounts and offers. It's a great way to showcase all your promotions in one place and drive traffic to your site.

<Tip>
  Best practice is to create a dedicated multi-offers page to showcase all your discounts in one place. To increase SEO traffic ensure the terms “discount codes”, “offers” and “coupon” (if wanting to rank in the the USA) are mentioned:

  - **Clear Page Slug:** i.e `discounts`
  - **Meta title and H1:** Official _Brand_ Discount Codes and Offers
  - **Meta description:** Did you just search for a _brand_ discount code? That's an intelligent move - you're obviously a savvy shopper. This is the official discount code page for _brand_ and you won't find a better discount elsewhere.
  - **Relevant Copy:** ~300 words talking about the rewards you offer and why they're important to your audience.
  - **FAQs:** Answer common questions about your rewards.
