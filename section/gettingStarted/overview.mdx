## Why use Gocertify?
Every year brands spend $1 trn attracting shoppers on-site - but 97\% of shoppers leave without making a purchase and \<4\% share the data needed for retargeting.

these rewards at scale you can boost conversion and retention while giving back to key communities.

## Introducing Reward Flows
Think of a Gocertify reward flow as the journey that your shoppers go on, from the moment they first learn about a reward on-site to the moment they redeem it.  

With Gocertify you can create as many of these custom reward flows as you want and tailor them to your brand and your audience. For example, creating a campaign around [unique rewards](/section/buildRewardFlows/chooseReward) (e.g. discounts or gift cards), gating offers to specific [target
audiences](/section/buildRewardFlows/closedUserGroups) (e.g. key workers or students), and leveraging our [DataCapture](/section/captureData/overview) features to collect valuable first party data (i.e. Email or D.O.B).
