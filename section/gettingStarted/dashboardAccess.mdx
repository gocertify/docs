## Your Reward Management Platform.

The [Gocertify dashboard](https://secure.gocertify.me/dashboard) is your central hub for managing reward campaigns, viewing shopper analytics, and configuring your promotions. Access is secured through password-based authentication with enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect your campaigns and data.

**What you can do in the dashboard:**
- View real-time shopper engagement reports and analytics
- Download CSV exports of verification data
- Configure on-site messages
- Manage team access and permissions


## Authentication Methods

Access to the Gocertify platform is secured with:

- **Password-Based Login:** Users create and manage their own passwords, reducing the risk of magic-linkâ€“related issues (such as intercepted or expired links).
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Login via Microsoft 365 or Google for seamless access.
- **Enforced Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** All logins require a one-time code sent to your registered email address.
- **Secure Session Management:** Each login requires both a valid password and a fresh 2FA code.
