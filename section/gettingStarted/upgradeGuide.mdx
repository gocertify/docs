<Tip>
  If you integrated Gocertify on your site before December 2024, you will need to upgrade to the new gocertify.js script.
</Tip>

We transitioned from the legacy `embed.js` script to the new `gocertify.js` script in December 2024. This change was necessary to improve performance and ensure compatibility with new features, like On Site Messaging.

We highly recommend upgrading to the new script as soon as possible, even though the old script is still supported.

## How to upgrade

The upgrade should be very straightforward, and it will depend on what features you are using.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Replace the script">
    Delete the old `embed.js` script and replace it with the new `gocertify.js` script.
    Follow the instructions in the [integrate on-site](/section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite) page to add the new script to your site.
    <Info>
      Note that the new script requires a unique parameter called `data-brand`.<br/>
      If you previously used `data-location="/at/your-brand/some-campaign"`, you now need to use `brand="your-brand"` instead.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include your iframe">
    If you are using the iframe feature, you will need to update the iframe code to the new `<gocertify-iframe>` tag.
    Follow the instructions in the [landing Pages](/section/gettingStarted/landingPages) page to add the new iframe to your site.
    <Info>
      Note that the new iframe tag requires a unique parameter called `source`.<br/>
      If you previously used `data-location="/at/your-brand/student"`, you now need to use `<gocertify-iframe source="student"></gocertify-iframe>` instead.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include your Offer Hub">
    If you are using the Offer Hub feature, you will need to update the Offer Hub code to the new `<gocertify-hub>` tag.
    Follow the instructions in the [Offer Hub](/section/promoteOffers/offerHub) page to add the new Offer Hub to your site.
    <Info>
      Note that the new tag doesn't require any extra parameters.<br/>
      If you previously used `data-location="/at/your-brand/hub"`, you now need to use simply `<gocertify-hub></gocertify-hub>` instead.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

The legacy `embed.js` script used the following optional attributes that are no longer supported:
