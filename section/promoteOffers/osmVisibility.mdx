The OSM visibility toolkit lets you control exactly when and where your offers are displayed to shoppers. There are six fundamental types of visibility rules. 


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Path" icon="link">
    Input plain text to match the path (https://secure.gocertify.me/ `this/is/the/path`) you want to show/hide the OSM. Use regex for more complex rules. If you add multiple paths
    within one rule, the offer will be displayed if the shopper navigates to any of the paths (i.e path1 OR path2).

## Popular Visibility Rule Use Cases
You can add multiple rules to a placement to combine these rules to match your campaign objectives. All rules need to be met for the offer to be displayed.
