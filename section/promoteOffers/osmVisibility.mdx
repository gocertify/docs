   Input plain text to match the path (https://secure.gocertify.me/ `this/is/the/path`) you want to show/hide the OSM. Use regex for more complex rules.

## Popular Visibility Rule Use Cases
You can add multiple rules to a placement to combine these rules to match your campaign objectives. All rules need to be met for the offer to be displayed.
