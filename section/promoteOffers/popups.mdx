Popups are a great way to keep shoppers in-flow, letting them verify and collect rewards without leaving the page they're browsing.
To set up a popup ensure you have [installed the head script](/section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite.mdx) and then simply add an onclick event to your given CTA, button or link and call the gocertify.popup function.


<CodeGroup>
```javascript Campaign Popup
gocertify.popup("student-youth")
```
```javascript Campaign Popup with clickref
//redirect to a specific page post verification
gocertify.popup("student-youth?clickref=...") 
```
```html Link with onclick event
<a href="#" onclick="gocertify.popup('campaign-name'); return false;">click here</a>
```
</CodeGroup>
