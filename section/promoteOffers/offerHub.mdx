OfferHub is a centralised location for all your discounts and offers. It's a great way to showcase all your discounts in one place and drive traffic to your site.

<Tip>
  Best practice is to create a dedicated multi-offers page to showcase all your discounts in one place. To increase SEO traffic ensure the terms “discount codes”, “offers” and “coupon” (if wanting to rank in the the USA) are mentioned:

  - **Clear Page Slug:** i.e `discounts`
  - **Meta title and H1:** Official _Brand_ Discount Codes and Offers
  - **Meta description:** Did you just search for a _brand_ discount code? That's an intelligent move - you're obviously a savvy shopper. This is the official discount code page for _brand_ and you won't find a better discount elsewhere.
  - **Relevant Copy:** ~300 words talking about the rewards you offer and why they're important to your audience.
  - **FAQs:** Answer common questions about your rewards.
