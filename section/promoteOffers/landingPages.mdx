Landing pages are a powerful tool for converting key communities and boosting your SEO.


## Create Campaign landing pages
<Tip>
  Best practice is to create dedicated landing pages for your high-priority communities, like Key Workers and Students.

  To increase SEO traffic ensure that the group name and “discount” is mentioned.

  - **Clear Page Slug:** i.e `student`, `key-worker`, `senior`, `youth`, `disability`
  - **Meta title and H1:** _company_ student discount
  - **Meta description:** We know that a little help goes a long way when you're a student. Verify your student status and you can get 10% off.
  - **Relevant Copy:** ~300 words talking about the campaign and why it's important to your audience.
