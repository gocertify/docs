Landing pages are a powerful tool for converting key communities and boosting your SEO. To get the most out of the gocertify experience we recommend you: 


  * **Create a landing page** for each of your high value campaigns (i.e. 20% off for Students) 
  * **Create multi-offers page** to showcase all your discounts in one place. 

## Create Campaign landing pages
<Tip>
  Best practice is to create dedicated landing pages for your high-priority communities, like Key Workers and Students.

  To increase SEO traffic ensure that the group name and “discount” is mentioned.

  - **Meta title and H1:** _company_ student discount
  - **Meta description:** We know that a little help goes a long way when you're a student. Verify your student status and you can get 10% off.
