On-site messaging (OSM) is a powerful way to drive conversions by surfacing offers directly on product/checkout pages, maximising conversion of high intent shoppers.
No additional development work is needed to add OSM to your site as long as the [head script](section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite) has already been installed.

## Types of on-site messaging
Out of the box, gocertify supports three main types of on-site messages, but with heavy customisation available you can build a tailored placement that meets your needs.
