On-site messaging (OSM) is a powerful way to drive conversions by surfacing offers directly on product/checkout pages, maximising conversion of high intent shoppers.
No additional development work is needed to add OSM to your site as long as the [head script](section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite) has already been installed.

## Types of on-site messaging
Out of the box, Gocertify supports three main types of on-site messages, but with heavy customisation available you can build a tailored placement that meets your needs.

## Managing on-site messaging

<Tip>
  Your on-site messages will only show if there are live offers available for the shopper. While your brand is still in setup you may not see your on-site messages.
</Tip>

You have full control of all your on-site messages via the [Gocertify dashboard](https://secure.gocertify.me/dashboard), including creating new placements, editing content and setting visibility rules.
