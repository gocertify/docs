Gocertify makes it easy to display dynamic variables in your on site messages. This is especially powerful when used to display the exact saving amount shoppers will receive for a given product item, driving higher conversion rates.

To enable this feature, you need to let Gocertify know a bit more about the page where the placement is
being displayed. Specifically, we need to know the price and the currency of the product that is being displayed.

You can do this by adding two extra data attributes (`data-purchase-amount` and `data-locale`) to the head script. See below for a tutorial based on the integration you are using.

<Tip>
  Make sure that the price is set in cents. For example, if the price is $10.99, the attribute should be set to **1099**.
</Tip>
<Tip>
  If you set the locale to **en-GB** and the purchase-amount to **1099**, the price will be interpreted as £10.99.
  If you leave this locale empty, we will use the main locale of the brand.

  <Accordion title="Google Tag Manager" icon="tag">
    Google tag manager supports dynamic variables that are tightly integrated with the data layer.
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Identify Variable Name">
        Navigate to the variable tab in [tag manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/#) and identify/create the variable that contains product price and note the name.
        To use the variable you'll need to replace the spaces with underscores so `Product Price` would be `product_price`.

      </Step>
        <Step title="Add New Line to Head Script">
        Navigate back to the Gocertify head script within the tags section and add a new line using the format `el.setAttribute('data-purchase-amount', '{{variable_name}}');` and the variable name you noted in the previous step.

        <Tip>
          Remember that the price should be set in cents, so you should need to parse that value to float and multiply it by 100.
          For example, `el.setAttribute('data-purchase-amount', parseFloat({{variable_name}}) * 100);`
        </Tip>

      <Step title="Save and Publish">
        Save and publish your changes. You should now see dynamic text in your on site messages.

  <Accordion title="Manually added Head Script" icon="code">
    If you added the gocertify.js script manually in the `<head>` section of your page, you can set the data attributes like this:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript JS
      el.setAttributes('data-purchase-amount', '{{variable}}')
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Via inline placement" icon="sign-hanging">
    If you added the Gocertify placement manually in the `<body>` section of your page, you can set the data attributes like this:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```PHP PHP
      <gocertify-placement id="<?= $placementId ?>" data-locale="en-GB" data-purchase-amount="<?= $price ?>"></gocertify-placement>
      ```

      ```Ruby Ruby
      <gocertify-placement id="<%= placement_id %>" data-locale="en-GB" data-purchase-amount="<%= price %>"></gocertify-placement>
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Variables

As mentioned above, by default your placement will include these two variables:

- `{{purchase-amount}}`: The price of the product, in cents (e.g. 1000 for £10).
- `{{locale}}`: The locale of the page, in ISO 639-1 format (e.g. `en-GB`).
- `{{currency}}`: The currency of the page, in ISO 4217 format (e.g. `GBP`).
- `{{savings-amount}}`: The savings amount of the product, calculated automatically based on the original price and the discount in the campaign.

<Tip>
  The "currency" variable was introduced in April 2025 and is optional. If you don't set it, we will use the currency associated to the locale.
</Tip>

You can also include custom variables by adding them to the placement. For example, if you want to include the product category, you can set the following call to action:

`==Save {{savings-amount}}== on this {{category}}`

Then, you need to set the value for that variable (as "data attribute") when rendering the placement. For example, if you want to set the category to "Shoes", you can do the following:

```
<gocertify-placement 
  id="p-123456" 
  data-locale="en-GB" 
  data-purchase-amount="9800" 
  data-category="Shoes">
</gocertify-placement>
```

Asuming that the maximum discount available on the campaigns associated to this placement (p-123456) is 20% off, the savings amount will be automatically calculated as 1960 (9800 * 20%), and the resulting text will be:

> **Save £19.60** on this Shoes

Of course, you will probably want to replace those hardcoded values with variables from your data layer (on Google Tag Manager, for example) or from your CMS.
