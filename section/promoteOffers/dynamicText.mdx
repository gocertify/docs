Gocertify makes it easy to display dynamic variables in your on site messages. This is especially powerful when used to display the exact saving amount shoppers will receive for a given product item, driving higher conversion rates.

To enable this feature, you need to let Gocertify know a bit more about the page where the placement is
being displayed. Specifically, we need to know the price and the currency of the product that is being displayed.

You can do this by adding two extra data attributes (`data-purchase-amount` and `data-locale`) to the head script. See below for a tutorial based on the integration you are using.

<Tip>
  Make sure that the price is set in cents. For example, if the price is $10.99, the attribute should be set to **1099**.
</Tip>
<Tip>
  If you set the locale to **en-GB** and the purchase-amount to **1099**, the price will be interpreted as Â£10.99.
  If you leave this locale empty, we will use the main locale of the brand.

    Google tag manager supports dynamic variables that are tightly integrated with the data layer.
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Identify Variable Name">
        Navigate to the variable tab in [tag manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/#) and identify/create the variable that contains product price and note the name.
        To use the variable you'll need to replace the spaces with underscores so `Product Price` would be `product_price`.

      </Step>
        <Step title="Add New Line to Head Script">
        Navigate back to the Gocertify head script within the tags section and add a new line using the format `el.setAttribute('data-purchase-amount', '{{variable_name}}');` and the variable name you noted in the previous step.

        <Tip>
          Remember that the price should be set in cents, so you should need to parse that value to float and multiply it by 100.
          For example, `el.setAttribute('data-purchase-amount', parseFloat({{variable_name}}) * 100);`
        </Tip>

      <Step title="Save and Publish">
        Save and publish your changes. You should now see dynamic text in your on site messages.
