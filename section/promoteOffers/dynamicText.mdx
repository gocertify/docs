gocertify makes it easy to display dynamic variables in your on site messages. This is especially powerful when used to display the exact saving amount shoppers will receive for a given product item, driving higher conversion rates.

To pass through a variable to your on site message you can use the add one extra line to your [head script](/section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite): `el.setAttribute('price', '{{variable}}')`. The variable has to match the key of the product attribute you want to display and will be replaced with the actual value when the message is displayed.
If the attribute with the key you specify does not exist, the variable will not display.

Many integrations have built in support for dynamic variables, for instructions expand the relevant section below:

Google tag manager supports dynamic variables that are tightly integrated with the data layer.
<Steps> 
<Step title="Identify Variable Name">
Navigate to the variable tab in [tag manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/#) and identify/create the variable that contains product price and note the name.
To use the variable you'll need to replace the spaces with underscores so `Product Price` would be `product_price`.

<Step title="Add New Line to Head Script">
Navigate back to the gocertify head script within the tags section and add a new line using the format `el.setAttribute('price', '{{variable_name}}');` and the variable name you noted in the previous step.
