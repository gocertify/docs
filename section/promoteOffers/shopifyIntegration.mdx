Gocertify has a native integration with Shopify. This allows you to easily promote Gocertify offers across your Shopify site. To install your shopify
app follow the Shopify Specific instructions in [Integrate on Site](/section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite#shopify). We also can connect directly to your [Shopify discounts](/section/buildRewardFlows/discounts#integrating-with-shopify) to create unique codes for each shopper.

Once installed you will be able to see the following Gocertify blocks in your Shopify builder:
- **iFrame block:** add a Gocertify [landing pages](/section/gettingStarted/landingPages) to your site
- **OfferHub block:** lets you drag and drop [OfferHub](/section/promoteOffers/OfferHub) on site
- **On-Site Message block:** lets you add [inline OSM messages](/section/promoteOffers/on-site-placements) to your site.

Other types of OSM (floating button, sticky bar etc) can all be enabled directly from the Gocertify dashboard as usual without the need to add any additional blocks.
