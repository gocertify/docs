Gocertify has a native integration with Shopify. This allows you to easily promote Gocertify offers across your Shopify site. To install your shopify
app follow the Shopify Specific instructions in [Integrate on Site](/section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite#shopify). We also can connect directly to your [Shopify discounts](/section/buildRewardFlows/discounts#integrating-with-shopify) to create unique codes for each shopper.

Once installed you will be able to see the following Gocertify blocks in your Shopify builder:
- **iFrame block:** add a Gocertify landing pages to your site and drag in the app block `iFrame`
- **OfferHub block:** add an offer page to your site and drag in the `OfferHub` block
- **On-Site Message block:** navigate to any page and drag in the `On-Site Message` block

Other types of OSM (floating button, sticky bar etc) can all be enabled directly from the Gocertify dashboard as usual without the need to add any additional blocks.
