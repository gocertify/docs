<Tip>
  Can shoppers choose different variants of your products, changing the price of the product? You will need to use this feature.
</Tip>

If you have a product that can be purchased in different variants, you will need to refresh the content of your placements dynamically each time the shopper changes the variant.

Our placements offer a simple way to refresh the content of your placements: Simply update the relevant data attribute of the placement (`data-purchase-amount`).

You can do it with this little snippet of JavaScript:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JS
  document.querySelectorAll('gocertify-placement').forEach(e => {
    e.setAttribute("data-purchase-amount", newPurchaseAmount);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Remember to replace the `newPurchaseAmount` with the actual value you want to set, in the same format as the one you set in the placement.
</Tip>

Our placements will automatically refresh the content of the placement when the `data-purchase-amount` data attribute is updated. 
If you are also using custom variables in your placements, you will need to update them and then trigger the refresh manually, using the `refresh` function. 
For example, let's say you are using the `category` variable in your placement, and you want to refresh the placement when the shopper changes the category:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JS
  document.querySelectorAll('gocertify-placement').forEach(e => {
    e.setAttribute("data-category", newCategory);
    e.refresh();
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Of course, if you have the `id` of the specific placement you want to refresh, you can do it with a single line of JavaScript:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JS
  let placement = document.getElementById('p-123456');
  placement.setAttribute("data-category", newCategory);
  placement.refresh();
  ```
</CodeGroup>
