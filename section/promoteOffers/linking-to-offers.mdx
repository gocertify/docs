While you can always link to your [landing pages](/section/promoteOffers/landingPages) or [OfferHub](/section/promoteOffers/offerHub) from high traffic areas of your site
Gocertify offers an even quicker solution for brands looking launch right away. For every campaign you create you can generate a link that will redirect to the campaign page hosted on the Gocertify platform.
If you'd rather not redirect shoppers off-site, consider using a [popup](/section/promoteOffers/popups) instead.
