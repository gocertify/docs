Once the user submits their email and/or mobile number, Gocertify saves the data within a secure and encrypted database. You can access these contacts [within your dashboard](https://secure.gocertify.me/dashboard) and export contacts to a CSV.

<Tip>
This is a manual process, you won't receive shopper data instantly, unlike with the [CDP integrations](/section/captureData/CDPintegrationOverview). This means you can't do automated sequences/actions each time a shopper is verified or claims and offer.
</Tip>

When you export this data you can process it accordingly (ie: creating a profile in your CRM). We will send you a weekly notification email letting you know how many new contacts have been added.
