Once the user submits their email and/or mobile number, Gocertify will try to generate a new Subscriber in Attentive. 
If the email is already in the list, it will add the mobile number to the existing subscriber.

After that screen, when the user successfully verifies as a target group (student, healthcare, senior, etc) 
a “Custom Event” (named “Gocertify”) will be sent to Attentive, including the details of the verification.

With this data, you will be able to generate smart Segments based on the details of these verifications 
(e.g. "Students who have verified in the last year").

## Requirements to go live

In a nutshell, you will need to create a new "Custom App" in your Attentive account, share the credentials with 
Gocertify, and contact your Attentive's account manager to create a new "Sign-up method" called "Gocertify" 
(and share its id with your Gocertify account manager).

<Accordion title="See step by step tutorial">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create a new custom app">
      Sign in to your [Attentive](https://ui.attentivemobile.com/) account and go to the "Marketplace" section, located in the left sidebar.

      Once in the Marketplace, click on the "+ Create app" button.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Fill in the details">
      Set the name of the app to "Gocertify", add your email address in the "Contact email" field, and 
      set the permissions to "Write" for "Custom Events" and "Subscribers".
      <img className="block" src="/images/attentiveCreateApp.png" alt="Attentive Create App" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Step>

    <Step title="Share the API key with Gocertify">
      After submitting the form, you will be redirected to the app details page, with the API key on a pop up.

      Copy that API key and share it with your Gocertify account manager, using [OneTimeSecret](https://onetimesecret.com/) to avoid exposing it in the chat.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Request a new Sign-up method">
      Contact your Attentive's account manager to create a new "Sign-up method" called "Gocertify".

      Once created, share its ID with your Gocertify account manager. You will find this method in the "Sign-up units" section, as shown below.

      <Tip>
        In the future, you will be able to create your Sign-up method directly in the "Sign-up units" section, 
        by clicking on the "Create sign-up unit" button.

## How data will appear in Attentive

Each shopper that shares their data with your brand will appear as a **"Subscriber"** in your Attentive account.

By default, they will have 2 subscriptions, one for **"Email marketing"** and another one for **"SMS marketing"**. 
Both subscriptions will need to be confirmed by them, by clicking a link in the email or the SMS. 
You can see the reference to "Gocertify" in their"Sign-up unit".

      alt="Attentive Subscriber Activities"
      style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}/>

## How to create segments in Attentive

In the side menu, go to the "Segments" section and click on the "+ Create segment" button and then:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose the type of segment">
    Choose "Dynamic segment" and then click on "Create".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose condition">
    In this first dropdown, select the first option, for "A subscriber's activity", as shown below.

    <img className="block" src="/images/attentiveChooseCondition.png" alt="Attentive Choose Condition" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose activitiy">
    In the second dropdown, scroll down and select the option "Gocertify", as shown below.

    <img className="block" src="/images/attentiveChooseActivity.png" alt="Attentive Choose Activity" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a filter">
    By default, you will have a filter for "at least once in the last 365 days", meaning that this segment
    will include all your subscribers that have interacted with your brand through Gocertify in the last year.

    <img className="block" src="/images/attentiveFilterBase.png" alt="Attentive Add Filter" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}/>

    Most of the time, you will want to add a second filter for each of the groups you have in your offers. 
    For example, if you have an offer for students, a filter for "Student" will be added to the segment.

    In order to do this, click in the "Filter" button and then select "parent_group" in the dropdown. 
    Then, select the group you want to add to the segment.

    <img className="block" src="/images/attentiveFilterCondition.png" alt="Attentive Add Filter" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the segment">
    Click on the "Create" button in the bottom right corner.
  </Step>
</Steps>
