When a shopper submits their email and/or mobile number, gocertify will send this data to the your Klaviyo account in the form of a gocertify event. This is represented by a “Profile” (either augmenting an existing one or creating a new one).
As the shopper goes on to successfully verify as a target group (student, healthcare, senior, etc) another “Event” will be triggered, with the label “verified as __”. 

With this data, you will be able to generate segments based on these events.

## Requirements to go live

In order to go live with Klaviyo, we will need the following:

- Private Klaviyo API Key
- Main Klaviyo lists for Email and SMS

### Share Private Klaviyo API Key
Please share a Private Klaviyo API Key must be generated and provided to the gocertify team. [See here how to generate one](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/7423954176283#before-you-begin1).

This API Key must be a “Custom” one, giving “Full Access” to Events, List, Profiles and Subscriptions, as shown here.

### Share Main Klaviyo list names
Please share the names of [your main Klaviyo lists](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043947571) (which have marketing consent) for:

1. Email
2. SMS

If you don't have a main list for each of these, we'll need a list for both channels so that we can subscribe the shopper with marketing permissions.

## How data will appear in Klaviyo

First gocertify will send the shopper's data to Klaviyo as a Profile. Within both verification and standard offers the profile will be subscribed to Email and/or SMS marketing.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/klaviyoProfile.png"
  alt="Klaviyo Profile"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>

We'll log an event on the profile when an offer has been claimed

<CardGroup>
<Card>
With verification-based offers e.g. students/key workers. Events will then be logged on a profile level for “Verified as `group`”

  src="/images/klaviyoVerificationProfile.png"
  alt="Klaviyo Verification Profile"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>


</Card>

With standard offers e.g. discounts. Events will then be logged on a profile level for “Offer claimed”

## How to create segments in Klaviyo
You can build segments based on the “verified as …” event for each group you'd like to verify. 
If you'd like a key worker group, you can use OR statements to create a wider group of many occupations.
