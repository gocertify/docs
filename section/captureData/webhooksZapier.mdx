Gocertify offers a webhook integration that allows you to connect with other services, including automations tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [Make](https://www.make.com/) and [Tray](https://tray.io/). 
This can be used to trigger automated actions each time a shopper is verified or claims an offer.

To go live simply provide the endpoint to the partners@gocertify.me - this endpoint will usually [be generated](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496083355661-How-to-get-started-with-Webhooks-by-Zapier) by your iPaaS (Make.com, Zapier, Tray, etc) or by your IT team.

## Webhook Events

We will send you two events. THe first event happens at Step 1 of the flow below (`Data sent to your CRM`), and the second event happens at Step 3 (`Verification status sent to CRM`).
