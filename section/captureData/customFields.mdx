By default, enabling datacapture will collect shopper emails, enabling you to run newsletter campaigns. However, with custom fields you can collect
any additional data you require to personalise the shopping experience and retarget shoppers. To standardise the data you can collect information using
radio buttons, dropdowns, date pickers or free text input.
