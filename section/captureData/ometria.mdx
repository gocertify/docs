Once the user submits their email and/or mobile number, Gocertify will send this data to the customer's Ometria account, and will create a Customer, subscribed to Email and/or SMS (according to the setup with gocertify). 

After that screen, when the user successfully verifies as a target group (student, healthcare, senior, etc) a “Custom Event” (named “gocertify”) will be triggered, including the details of the verification.

With this data, you will be able to generate segments based on these events.

## Requirements to go live
To set up Ometria you will need to share your Ometria API key with the Gocertify team.

    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    />

</Step>

<Step title="Name your API key">
     Add a name for this new API key, we recommend using “gocertify” or “gocertify integration”

    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/integrations/cdp/ometria/ometriaNameAPIKey.png"

    />

</Step>

<Step title="Share with Gocertify">
    Go to onetimesecret.com and paste the new generated API key there. Even if it's not required, we encourage you to also add a random “Passphrase”. This will generate a secret link that will expire within 7 days and will be visible only once.
    Share this link with your Customer Success Manager, and we will enable your integration.

## How data will appear in  Ometria


Before you are able to see this information in your Ometria account, you will need to ask your Customer Success (at Ometria) to setup this Custom Event. Note that this can take up to 1 week.
Once set up, the data will appear in your Ometria account as a Custom Event, with the name “gocertify”:

```JSON Example of a Gocertify event in Ometria
    [{
        "@type": "custom_event",
        event_type: "gocertify",
        id: "gcme-ABCD1234",
        timestamp: Time.now.iso8601,
        identity_email: "gustavo@gocertify.me",
        properties: {
        type: "Code",                         // ← it could be "Code" or "Deal"
        group_type: "Occupation",             // ← might not be present
        group_parent: "Key Worker",           // ← might not be present
        group_child: "NHS Worker",            // ← might not be present
        coupon_code: "EXAMPLECODE",           // ← might not be present if it's a "Deal" type.
        token: "ABCD1234"                     // ← our internal randomly generated identifier
        brand_slug: "amazon",                 // ← the identifier of the customer
        campaign_id: 1234,                    // ← the gocertify's campaign's identifier
        campaign_title: "20% OFF for Key Workers",  // ← the title of the campaign
        campaign_url: "https://secure.gocertify.me/at/amazon",   // ← the url of our campaign
        iframe_parent_url: "https://www.customer-website/keyworkers",  // ← might not be present
        date: Time.now.iso8601                // ← the current date, in iso8601 format.
        }
    }]
```

## How to create segments in Ometria
Once the Ometria team has enabled our Custom Event in your account, you will be able to create specific segments.

Go to the Segment Explorer menu and then click on “Filter customers”. Now, click on “+ Add Condition”, browse to the end of the list and select “Custom Events”, now you should see a “gocertify” item.

<Tip>
Please note that if you don't see this event there, it means your Customer Success at Ometria hasn't enabled the event yet.
</Tip>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/integrations/cdp/ometria/ometriaFilterSegment.png"
  alt="Ometria Filter Segment"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>

Once you selected “gocertify”, you will see many different options to create a condition. The simplest one is “Event occurred”. Use this one (that is present) to filter every customer that has been verified or claimed a general offer through gocertify.

  alt="Ometria Create Condition"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/integrations/cdp/ometria/ometriaCreateCondition.png"
  alt="Ometria Create Condition"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>

If you want to create a segment for each group we currently verify, you can then use the “Group Type”, “Group Parent” or “Group Child” attributes, according to this table of groups. For example:

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/integrations/cdp/ometria/ometriaCustomerFilter.png"
  alt="Ometria Customer Filter"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/integrations/cdp/ometria/ometriaCustomerFilter.png"
  alt="Ometria Customer Filter"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>
