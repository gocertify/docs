Datacapture is enabled at the brand level with the ability to apply datacpature to all campaigns or just closed group/open campaigns.
Once switched on shoppers will experience an additional step in the reward flow where they can opt-in to share their data in return for rewards. This screen will
appear after login but before verification.
