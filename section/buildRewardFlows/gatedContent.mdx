After a successful verification, the shopper will be redirected to your gated 
content using what we call a **"magic link"**. 

This magic link could include an optional `signature` parameter that will let you validate its
authenticity, giving you the confidence to provide secure access to private content 
or storefronts with the discounts pre-applied.

<Tip>
    If you don't need to validate the authenticity of the magic link, then it can simply be the destination URL of your gated content.

## Requirements for signature validation

You need to ask your Customer Success Manager to set a **Signature Key** to your brand. 
If you manage more than one brand (one per territory, for example), you will need 
a different signature key for each brand. 

**Important**: Don't share nor use this signature key in any public-facing code.

## Setup

You will need to build a small page that will act as a proxy between the shopper and the gated content. 
Gocertify will then use this page as the magic link destination.

When redirecting the shopper to this proxy page, Gocertify will add the following query parameters:

- `signed_token`: A unique identifier of the reward flow (related to the shopper and the specific campaign).
- `clicktimestamp`: The time (UTC timestamp) when the shopper clicked the magic link.
- `signature`: The **SHA256** hash of `gocertify{{clicktimestamp}}{{signed_token}}{{signature_key}}`

An example of the full URL would be, assuming the signature key is `1234567890`:

```
https://your-page.com/proxy?clicktimestamp=20250326143831&signedtoken=af551f61&signature=21a07e72ef34d9546e1f41c56171f2990f5fa083a9f516ee891a394838062eca
```

## Authenticating the magic link

The proxy page will need to recreate the signature using the same parameters and then confirm it's the same one that was received as query string.

Optionally, you can also validate the `clicktimestamp` is no older than X seconds (10 seconds is a good default).

Here's a sample implementation:

<CodeGroup>
    ```rb proxy.rb
        clicktimestamp = params[:clicktimestamp]
        signed_token = params[:signed_token]
        signature = params[:signature]
        signature_key = ENV['GOCERTIFY_SIGNATURE_KEY']

        input = ["gocertify", clicktimestamp, signed_token, signature_key].compact_blank.join
        computed_signature = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(input)

        if computed_signature == params[:signature] && clicktimestamp.to_time > 10.seconds.ago
            # The signature is valid
        end
    ```
    ```php proxy.php
        $clicktimestamp = $_GET['clicktimestamp'];
        $signed_token = $_GET['signed_token'];
        $signature = $_GET['signature'];
        $signature_key = getenv('GOCERTIFY_SIGNATURE_KEY');

        $input = "gocertify" . $clicktimestamp . $signed_token . $signature_key;
        $computed_signature = hash('sha256', $input);

        if ($computed_signature == $signature && $clicktimestamp.to_i > time() - 10) {
            // The signature is valid
        }
    ```
    ```js proxy.js
        const clicktimestamp = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('clicktimestamp');
        const signed_token = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('signed_token');
        const signature = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('signature');
        const signature_key = ENV['GOCERTIFY_SIGNATURE_KEY'];
        
        const input = "gocertify" + clicktimestamp + signed_token + signature_key;
        const computed_signature = crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', new TextEncoder().encode(input))
            .then(buf => buf.subarray(0, 8).toString('hex'))
            .then(console.log);

        if (computed_signature == signature && clicktimestamp.to_i > Time.now.to_i - 10) {
            // The signature is valid
        }
    ```
