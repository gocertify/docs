Discounts are the most common reward type used by brands, and can be used to convert shoppers with monetary (Â£) or percentage off (%) incentives. If you'd 
rather provide secure access to a storefront with the discounts pre-applied, you can use our [Gated Content](/section/buildRewardFlows/gatedContent) reward type instead.

<Tip>
  We recommend adding a prefix e.g. HEALTH-20 for Healthcare Workers - so you can run personalisation for each group using your CRM / CDP

## Unique codes
Unique, or single-use codes let you give every shopper a different discount code. We require a CSV of these codes or can integrate directly with your
preferred ecommerce platform or promotion service.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Uploading CSV" icon="file-csv">

<Accordion title="Integrating with Shopify" icon="shopify">
    We can fetch codes directly from your Shopify discount feed (follow the Shopify installation instructions in [Integrate on Site](/section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite#shopify)). 
    
    We will create a new unique code for each shopper, ensuring that you never run out of codes and can easily track performance.

## Multi-use (generic) codes
Multi-use codes, also known as generic or vanity codes, let you give every shopper of the same campaign the same discount code e.g. `SAVE20`. To avoid leakage, where codes are shared outside of your expected channels, we recommend making these codes distinct and unique to your campaign. Provide us with the code and we'll apply it to your campaign.
