Gift cards are a powerful way of both converting shoppers and encouraging repeat purchases. Once a shopper has verified their status, and purchased an item,
gocertify will issue a gift card via SMS automatically once the transaction is approved by your network. 


<Accordion title="Uploading CSV of gift cards" icon="file-csv">
    The easiest way to issue gift cards is to provide the gocertify client success team with a CSV of unique gift card URLs. We will provide each shopper with this URL via SMS when qualifying transactions are approved by your network.
