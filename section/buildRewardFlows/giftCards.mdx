<Tip>
  **Important:** This flow requires a connection to your Affiliate Network (through affiliate links).
</Tip>

Gift cards are a powerful way of both converting shoppers and encouraging repeat purchases. Once a shopper has verified their status, and purchased an item,
gocertify will issue a gift card via SMS automatically once the transaction is approved by your network.

You will need to issue e-gift card codes in your network (or through your own system). They can be in the form of a unique code or a unique URL.

<Accordion title="Uploading CSV of gift cards" icon="file-csv">
  Once you have generated a list of e-gift card codes, you can send the resulting CSV file to your Customer Success Manager.
  We will notify you when we are running out of gift card codes.
</Accordion>

From a shopper's perspective, the flow is as follows:

<Frame caption="Shopper journey for the gift card flow">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Shopper verifies">
      Shopper verifies their status using gocertify.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Qualifying purchase made">
      Shopper purchases an item, which is tracked through your affiliate network.
    </Step>
    <Step title="First notification">
      Once gocertify receives the transaction from the Affiliate Network (typically within 24 hours), we will send a notification to the shopper.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Gift Card Issued">
      Once the transaction is approved by the Affiliate Network (typically 60 days after the purchase), we will issue the gift card to the shopper.
    </Step>
  </Steps>

## Configuring the flow

Each campaign at gocertify can have a specific flow configured, setting some rules for the gift card assignment:

- **Purchase amount**: The minimum purchase amount that qualifies for a gift card.
- **Commission amount**: A value (or range) for the commission amount that qualifies for a gift card.
- **Gift card batch (CSV)**: The CSV file containing the gift card codes.

For example, you could have 2 campaigns running at the same time:

- Campaign 1: _"Get a £20 gift card for purchases over £100"_
- Campaign 2: _"Get a £50 gift card for purchases over £200"_

A shopper could use the Campaign 2 flow (as it has a higher gift card value), and end up buying a £150 item.

In this case, even though they use the Campaign 2 flow, they will receive a £20 gift card, as the purchase amount matches the Campaign 1 flow, and not the Campaign 2 flow.

## Advanced configuration

If you want to have more control over what specific purchases should qualify for a gift card, you can use the commission amount rule.

For example, you could have a campaign like this one:

- Campaign 3: _"Get a £40 gift card when purchasing the latest iPhone"_

And we set a specific commission amount for this campaign, let's say £10.55.

Then, you can set your own rules on your Affiliate Network to assign that specific commission amount if the item purchased is the latest iPhone.

All the rest of the flow will work as expected, and the shopper will receive a £40 gift card once the transaction (with a commission amount of £10.55) is approved by the Affiliate Network.
