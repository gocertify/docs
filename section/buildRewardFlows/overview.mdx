Campaigns form the fundamental building blocks of reward flows. When you create a campaign you can:

* [Choose the reward](/section/buildRewardFlows/chooseReward) you want to offer (e.g 20% off to Key Workers)
* [Customise the copy](/section/buildRewardFlows/customiseCopy) and design of the campaign
* [Gate the offer](/section/buildRewardFlows/closedUserGroups) to a specific audience (or make it available to all shoppers)
* [Enable DataCapture](/section/captureData/overview) to collect information from shoppers (e.g email address)

You can also group campaigns, enabling you to have one parent campaign (i.e. <a href="https://secure.gocertify.me/at/gosnow/key-worker">Key Worker Discounts</a>) and then have child campaigns (i.e. <a href="https://secure.gocertify.me/at/gosnow/key-worker/healthcare">Healthcare Workers</a> and <a href="https://secure.gocertify.me/at/gosnow/key-worker/teacher">Teachers</a>).

section to learn more about how to leverage rewards to understand your customers better or the [Promotion](/section/promoteOFfers/overview) section
