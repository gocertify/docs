Gocertify centralises reward management, simplifying how you tailor and distribute them to your brand and your audience. The key reward types are:

- [Discounts](/section/buildRewardFlows/discounts) - unique or multi-use codes for monetary (Â£) and percentage off (%)
- [Gift Cards](/section/buildRewardFlows/giftCards) - delivered digitally after qualifying purchases
- [Gated Content](/section/buildRewardFlows/gatedContent) - Exclusive access to a discounted pricing storefront or premium content

<Tip>
  You can link your preferred reward playform (i.e. Uniqodo) to your Gocertify account for an automated reward feed or simply upload a CSV file of your existing offers.
