  ## Bloomreach Custom Fields
  We've added support for syncing custom fields to Bloomreach. This means you can now sync additional information about your customers to your Bloomreach account, such as their first name, preferred dress size, department preference, and more.
  
  Additionally, we've introduced a new type of custom field, called "multiple choice", which allows the shopper to select multiple options from a list of options.

  Find more information in the [Collect Custom Fields](/section/captureData/customFields) section.

  ## Shopify App
  We are releasing our brand new Shopify app. It will allow our customers to quickly install our script and enable all of our features on their Shopify stores. 
  
  As a bonus, it will also simplify the hussle of manually generating unique coupon codes for their customers, by automatically generating them when needed.

  Find more information in the [Integrate on Site](/section/gettingStarted/integrateOnSite#shopify) section.
  
  <Info>
    This app is currently in beta and not listed on the Shopify App Store. If you want to try it out, please contact your Customer Success Manager.
