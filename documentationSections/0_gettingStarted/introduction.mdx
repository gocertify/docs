## Quickstart

Deploy gocertify site-wide, by adding our <Tooltip tip="Our script is just 12kb and optimised for performance">lightweight script</Tooltip> to the `<head>` of your site ([no developer needed](integrateOnSite)). This enables you to launch your offers within minutes and have full control over the shopper experience through our self-serve platform.

To maximise performance we recommend also building dedicated [landing pages](landingPages) for your highest value campaigns.
