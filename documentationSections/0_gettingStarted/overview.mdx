## Why use gocertify?
Every year brands spend $1 trn attracting shoppers on-site - but 97\% of shoppers leave without making a purchase and \<4\% share the data needed for retargeting.

Today over 450 brands, from Puma to Samsung, use gocertify to convert these shoppers using targeted, gated reward flows.

## Introducing Reward Flows
Reward flows are the journey that your shoppers go on, from the moment they first see your reward to the moment they redeem it. By deploying
these reward flows you can boost conversion and retention while giving back to key communities. 

With gocertify you can create as many of these custom reward flows as you want and tailor them to your brand and your audience. For example, many brands choose to gate offers to specific [target
audiences](/documentationSections/1_buildRewardFlows/closedUserGroups.mdx) (Key workers or Students), build campaigns around [unique rewards](/documentationSections/1_buildRewardFlows/chooseReward.mdx) (10% off or Free delivery) or leverage our [Data Capture](/documentationSections/2_captureData/overview.mdx) features to exchange rewards for valuable first party data (i.e. Email or D.O.B).
