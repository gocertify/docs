## ðŸš€ Why use gocertify?
Every year brands spend $1 trn attracting shoppers on-site - but 97\% of shoppers leave without making a purchase and \<4\% share the data needed for retargeting.

Today over 450 brands, from Puma to Samsung, use gocertify to convert these shoppers using targeted, gated rewards. By deploying
these rewards at scale you can boost conversion and retention while giving back to key communities.

## ðŸ‘£ Introducing Reward Flows
Think of a gocertify reward flow as the journey that your shoppers go on, from the moment they first learn about a reward on-site to the moment they redeem it.  

With gocertify you can create as many of these custom reward flows as you want and tailor them to your brand and your audience. For example, creating a campaign around [unique rewards](/documentationSections/1_buildRewardFlows/chooseReward) (10% off or Free delivery), gating offers to specific [target
audiences](/documentationSections/1_buildRewardFlows/closedUserGroups) (e.g. Key workers or Students), and leveraging our [Data Capture](/documentationSections/2_captureData/overview) features to exchange rewards for valuable first party data (i.e. Email or D.O.B).
