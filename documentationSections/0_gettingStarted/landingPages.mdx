Landing pages are a powerful tool for converting key communities and boosting your SEO. To get the most out of the gocertify experience we recommend you: 


  * **Create a landing page** for each of your high value campaigns (i.e. 20% off for Students) 
  * **Integrate OfferHub** to showcase all your discounts in one place. 

## Create Campaign landing pages
<Tip>
  Best practice is to create dedicated landing pages for your high-priority communities, like keyworkers and students.
