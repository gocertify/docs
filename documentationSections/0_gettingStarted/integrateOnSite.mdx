## Setup

Integrate gocertify by adding the following gocertify <Tooltip tip="Our script is just 12kb and optimised for performance">script</Tooltip> to your site's `<head>` using either a tag manager (no developer needed) or manually pasting it in (basic HTML knowledge recommended). The setup takes less than 2 minutes!

```javascript gocertify-script
        <script>
          (function() {
            var el = document.createElement("script");
            el.setAttribute("src", "https://assets.gocertify.me/assets/gocertify.js");
            el.setAttribute("data-brand", "example-company"); //replace example-company with your company name
            el.setAttribute("defer", "true");
            document.body.appendChild(el);
          })();
        </script>
      ```

### Option 1: Use tag manager (no dev required)
