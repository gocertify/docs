## üèóÔ∏è Integration steps

Integrate gocertify by adding our <Tooltip tip="Our script is just 12kb and optimised for performance">lightweight script</Tooltip> to the `<head>` of your site ([no developer needed](integrateOnSite)). This enables you to launch your offers within minutes and have full control over the shopper experience through our self-serve platform (supported by your helpful gocertify account manager).

In addition to adding the head script, we recommend also building dedicated [landing pages](landingPages) for your highest value campaigns to maximise performance.
