With price etc you can do this now in google tag manager with variables (put it into the embed). Price = {{variable}}

For shopify, CSM, Wordpress the variable is there

—

Manually - PHP variable


- Create variable, data layer variable






Support variables in both placements and head script but the variables should be in the head if possible.




el.setAttribute('data-location', '/at/exampleCompany');


el.setAttribute(‘price’, ‘{{variable}}’)

Change el to gocertify?

gocertify.setAttribute(…)
