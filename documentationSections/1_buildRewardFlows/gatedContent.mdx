The gocertify magic link let's you provide secure access to private content or storefronts with the discounts pre-applied post verification. 

To enable this security you can use the `data-subid` attribute to pass gocertify a value e.g. a `session_id` or `user_id`. gocertify can then 
pass back this attribute alongside a `token` (a random 8 chars string unique to the verification request). You can then validate the authenticity of that request in two ways:

## üñäÔ∏è Option 1: Adding a request signature

One initial validation we can do is add an extra parameter to this url, called signature.

This signature will be a JWT (using a custom **API key** and a ‚Äú**HS256**‚Äú cryptographic algorithm) of the whole query string. Using the previous url (the one with subid, token and group), the string that would be signed would be:

`**subid**=234790**&token**=asdc1234**&group**=student`

So we will add the resulting hash as the signature, like this:

[https://www.amazon.com/student**?subid**=234790**&token**=asdc1234**&group**=student**&signature**=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.ImdvY2VydGlmeV91c2VyaWQ9MzkyMDEmc3ViaWQ9MTIzNCZ0b2tlbj1BQkNEIg.-SzruyQvh8DOEOrKSrQJ-RXL4o-lpU97dN-7twsl_qM](https://www.amazon.com/student?subid=234790&token=asdc1234&group=student&signature=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.ImdvY2VydGlmeV91c2VyaWQ9MzkyMDEmc3ViaWQ9MTIzNCZ0b2tlbj1BQkNEIg.-SzruyQvh8DOEOrKSrQJ-RXL4o-lpU97dN-7twsl_qM)

You can get the parameters (excluding the signature) and try to generate the signature for those in your end. You should get exactly the same signature we added as the parameter. If it‚Äôs different, it means the user updated one or more parameters, so you shouldn‚Äôt trust that request.

<Tip>
üîë Get your API key by emailing [partners@gocertify.me](mailto:partners@gocertify.me). Please store the key safely so you will be able to validate our requests

## ü§ù Option 2: Validation API
When you can't use the request signature and still need to validate in gocertify the authenticity of a request. You can use our simple Validation API. 
When you send the parameters back to gocertify we will respond with our version of that specific verification process.

The main flow is shown in the figure below:
