Campaigns form the fundamental building blocks of reward flows. When you create a campaign you can:

* [Choose the reward](/documentationSections/1_buildRewardFlows/chooseReward) you want to offer (e.g 20% off to Key Workers)
* [Customise the copy](/documentationSections/1_buildRewardFlows/customiseCopy) and design of the campaign
* [Gate the offer](/documentationSections/1_buildRewardFlows/closedUserGroups) to a specific audience (or make it available to all shoppers)
* [Enable datacapture](/documentationSections/2_captureData/overview) to collect information from shoppers (e.g email address)
