Campaigns are the fundamental building blocks of reward flows. When you create a campaign you can:

* [Choose the reward](/docs/1_buildRewardFlows/chooseReward) you want to offer
* [Gate the offer](/docs/1_buildRewardFlows/closedUserGroups) to a specific audience 
* [Enable datacapture](/docs/2_captureData/overview) to collect information from shoppers
