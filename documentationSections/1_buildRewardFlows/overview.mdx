## What is a Reward Flow?
Think of a reward flow as the journey that your shoppers take to unlock a reward. It's a series of steps that guide them 
through the process of claiming a reward, from the moment they first see your offer to the moment they redeem it. By deploying
these reward flows you can boost conversion and retention while giving back to key communities. 

With gocertify you can create custom reward flows that are tailored to your brand and your audience, for example gating offers to specific target
audiences (Key workers or Students), offering unique rewards (10% off or Free delivery) and defining the exact data you are collecting during the flow (i.e. Email or D.O.B).

In this section we are going to focus on the core components of a reward flow and how you can use them to create a successful campaign. For more 
information on how to promote your reward flow, check out our [Promote Offers](/documentationSections/3_promoteOffers/overview) section, and to learn more about 
data capture, check out our [Data Capture](/documentationSections/2_captureData/overview.mdx) section.
