Discounts are the most common reward type used by brands, and can be used to convert shoppers with monetary (Â£) or percentage off (%) incentives. If you'd 
rather provide secure access to a storefront with the discounts pre-applied, you can use our [Gated Content](/documentationSections/1_buildRewardFlows/gatedContent) reward type instead.

<Tip>
  We recommend adding a prefix e.g. HEALTH-20 for Healthcare Workers - so you can run personalisation for each group using your CRM / CDP
