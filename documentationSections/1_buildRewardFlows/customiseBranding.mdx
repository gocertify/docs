A crucial part of your reward flow is its branding. This is the first thing your users will see, 
and it's important to make sure that the shopper experience closely aligns with your brand guidelines.

In this chapter we will explore how how you can customise the visuals, copy and styling of your reward flow to make sure it's a perfect fit for your brand.

## Customise your visuals

#### Favicon, Logo and Banner Image
The brand logo and banner image is shown on the key screens throughout the reward flow and the favicon is shown on any 
[go-certify hosted](https://secure.gocertify.me/at/gosnow) landing pages that you may link to. 

Provide the image files, with the correct dimensions (listed below), to your gocertify account manager and we will handle the rest.

<Frame caption = "Ideal dimensions for your favicon are 36 x 36 px">
<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/exampleFavicon.png"
    alt="Example Favicon in Reward Flow"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/exampleFavicon.png"
    alt="Example Favicon in Reward Flow"
/>
</Frame>

<Frame caption = "Ideal dimensions for your banner are 1500 x 500 px - if you have a Twitter/X banner this size works perfectly">
<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/exampleBanner.png"
    alt="Example Banner in Reward Flow"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/exampleBanner.png"
    alt="Example Banner in Reward Flow"
/>
</Frame>

<Frame caption = "Ideal dimensions for your logo are any square logo, minimum width 500px">
<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/logoExample.png"
    alt="Example Logo in Reward Flow"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/logoExample.png"
    alt="Example Logo in Reward Flow"
/>
</Frame>

#### Fonts
Provide up to 4 font files to customise the heading, normal, tagline and fineprint text.

<Frame caption = "Font files will be applied to the following sections of the flow">
<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/exampleFonts.png"
    alt="Example Font in Reward Flow"
    />
